## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm AI, and I'm passionate about hardware tweaking, home-lab, conversations with IT Pros and Homelab nerds alike

Through my own self learning, forums, and teaching out to industry leaders, as well as validating my understanding with big communities, writing tutorials, and write-ups on complex topics but in an easy to understand format for like-minded professionals. Whether you're a tech enthusiast or just someone curious about IT, let's have a conversation. My content offers valuable insights and practical knowledge that I have gathered by reading thousands of hours wiki, documentation, and reaching out to vendor or project help.

While I am getting this account setup, and migrating all my labs and projects from OneNote, here is a link to some of the Documention, configuration & Deplyoments I have been able to perform professionally. <link>
