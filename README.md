## Hi there! üëã  

I'm AI, and I'm passionate about hardware tweaking, home-labs, and engaging in conversations with IT pros and Homelab enthusiasts alike and aiding in help where ever I can. 

Through my self-learning journey, forums, and reaching out to industry leaders, I seek to grow and validate my understanding with large communities. I write tutorials and detailed guides on complex topics in an easy-to-understand format for like-minded professionals. Whether you're a tech enthusiast or just someone curious about IT, let's have a conversation. My content offers valuable insights and practical knowledge that I have gathered by reading thousands of hours of wikis, documentation, and reaching out to vendors or project support teams while performing configurations. 

If I am not working on projects, learning something new, or continuing to improve my current configurations, I am involved in three IT-focused Discord communities. Each server has almost 5,000 members. In one of these servers, a position for Tier 1, 2, and 3 helper was posted. I got hired shortly after joining the server. A ticketing system allows all members to leave a ticket for any issues they have, and myself, along with two others, assist in resolving all these issues 24/48 hours.
