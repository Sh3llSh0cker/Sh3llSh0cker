## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm AI, and I'm passionate about hardware tweaking, home-labs, and engaging in conversations with IT pros and Homelab enthusiasts alike and aiding in help where ever I can. 

Through my self-learning journey, forums, and reaching out to industry leaders, I seek to grow and validate my understanding with large communities. I write tutorials and detailed guides on complex topics in an easy-to-understand format for like-minded professionals. Whether you're a tech enthusiast or just someone curious about IT, let's have a conversation. My content offers valuable insights and practical knowledge that I have gathered by reading thousands of hours of wikis, documentation, and reaching out to vendors or project support teams while performing configurations.

While I am setting up this account and migrating all my labs and projects from OneNote, here is a link to some of the documentation, configurations, and deployments I have performed professionally. [Link]
